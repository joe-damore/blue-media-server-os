# Blue Media Server OS
Universal Blue-based media server OS

## Overview
Blue Media Server OS is a [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/)-based server operating system to power a Plex- or Jellyfin-based media server with easy installation and configuration.

This is a personal project intended for my own devices. I do not recommend or support this system for general use.
